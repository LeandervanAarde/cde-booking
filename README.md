### Project Description

Welcome to the CDE program, 
This web based application is a management system that allows Receptionists to manage the adminstration of the CDE Doctors office, managing patients, Doctors, Receptionist and appointments. The aim of this applicatiion was to learn the fundamentals of CRUD functioinallity in PHP and apply it to REACT. It is also aimed at giving Receptionists a user-friendly experience and an easy way to manage a booking portal.

### See all available appointments by clicking on the Calendars dates! 
See,Book, update and remove all available appointments for anytime on any day! The calendar on the CDE allows Receptionists to see availabilities for the near and far future. 

### See booked appointments for current week
See all booked appointments for the current week (start to end) so that Receptionists can confirm appointments with patients and cancel if needed. 

### Add, edit and remove people from the application
Remove old patients, Doctors and Receptionists that have left the CDE or CDE program. This allows the system to remain light weight and easy to scroll through. 
Edit all members as information is changed such as email etc. 
Visually see all members and add members to the system!

### Talk to other Staff members on the live chat
Get staff updates and talk to other members to keep up to date with what is happening in the CDE to ensure nothing goes missing, this allows staff members to avoid missing important information and updates based around the CDE.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. <br>
For this specific project, I had taken inspiration from other medical websites and the current CDE webiste to implement a more efficient dashboard design, keeping in mind that this would primarily be used for appointment booking. This project incorporates simplicity and encourages interaction on it. The main idea behin the project was to ease the process of managing an entire syste, thus making work easier for CDE members. 
<br> 
Throughout the concept process I had also started learning more about REACT to make the project easier for myself as well as making it more efficient. This would make for a more successful project overall. Furthemore, I had to conceptually understand the limitations that I had considering my basic knowledge of PHP. 

### Ideation

### Wireframes
  Wireframing fell as part of my planning process, these wireframes would guide me in the right direction and would assist me in planning my content in order to ge the best possible outcan that I could possibly get for this project.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized momentJS in order to create the calendar, get weekly and daily appointments. This would make that I could make bookings far ahead of time and view appointments in the near future. 
* Implementation of Socket io to make a chat room. This makes use of web sockets in order to send and receive messages on the Chat component. This required an additional serverside folder in order to make this possible
* Express was implemented as part of the backend for the chat component
* SASS was implemented in order to make styling more efficient and easier to understand, this could also assist with consistency of colours throughout the project.
* Components were made more re-usable so that I could access them in different places, this also allows for less code to do more and future developers can read it and understand it more (we hope!). 
* Implementation of PHP and SQL as backend to store, create, read, update and delete data. 

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Over the course of this project, the highlight for me was the impementation of Socket Io, this was especially exciting because it added an extra layer of excitement to the application. 
* Using PHP has taught me the basics of backend development and SQL databases. This was a highlight as it has the potential to open up many more doors.
* I enjoyed the challenges that these two languages have brought, although it was extremely difficult, I have a new respect for Php and what it has to offer.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* One of my largest challenges in this project was an error that is still active, there is an issue with the useEffects that cause an infinite loop, thus information does not properly update unless the application is reloaded everytime a change is made. This is especially frustrating because it defeats the purpose of SPA=. 
* The intergration of PHP and REACT was fairly difficult and was proven to be a challenge throuhgout the entire project. This issue was resolved through numerous work arounds and self study. In the end the project was successful, but it was fairly challenging
* Consistency was a big issue in this problem , I've noticed that this is a challenge among most of the applications that I have developed. This is something that I will pay more attention to in the future, but this was a step in the right direction. 

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* SocketIo Chatroom
* This project made use of SocketIo in order to create a chatroom. Socket Io makes use of webSockets in order to create a communication between client and server. This was not part of the brief but it was something that I felt could be fairly benificial to the application. 
+ MomentJS.
* Moment JS was used as a way to incorporate formatted dates into the application, this was used throughout the entire application to apply functionality. It was also used in the creation of the calendar. 
* SASS
* Sass was used as a means to make Css more readable due to its structure. SCSS allows for external files to be linked. This was used to create more consistency in the front end of the application with the use of variables. The variables would allow me to predefine aspects such as fonts and colours to be re-used. Variables would also avoid aspects of too much repetition and making the code look un neat. 

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
* In future I would like to implement better back end and make use of table relations and prepared statements. This will make the application more usable and more secure, while teaching me better practice for industry standard 
* In the future I would like to implement a better, more consistent front end that is more attractive to the viewers. 
*  A future improvement that I would like to incorporate is the image upload, due to time constraints I was not able to incorporate this into the project.
